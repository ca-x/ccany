# Claude Code Request Handling Bug Fixes

## Overview
This document identifies and addresses critical bugs and missing features in the Claude Code request handling implementation when compared to the reference implementations.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Critical: Incomplete SSE Event Sequence**

**Problem**: The current streaming implementation is missing the complete Server-Sent Events (SSE) sequence that Claude Code expects.

**Current Implementation Issues**:
- Missing `message_start` event with proper metadata
- Missing `content_block_start` event
- Missing `ping` events for keep-alive
- Missing `content_block_stop` event
- Missing `message_delta` event with proper stop reason
- Missing `message_stop` event

**Expected SSE Sequence**:
```
event: message_start
data: {"type":"message_start","message":{"id":"msg_123","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[],"model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022","stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0}}}

event: content_block_start
data: {"type":"content_block_start","index":0,"content_block":{"type":"text","text":""}}

event: ping
data: {"type":"ping"}

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type":"content_block_delta","index":0,"delta":{"type":"text_delta","text":"Hello"}}

event: content_block_stop
data: {"type":"content_block_stop","index":0}

event: message_delta
data: {"type":"message_delta","delta":{"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null},"usage":{"output_tokens":10}}

event: message_stop
data: {"type":"message_stop"}
```

### 2. **Critical: Missing Request Cancellation Support**

**Problem**: No client disconnect detection or request cancellation mechanism.

**Issues**:
- Continues processing even if client disconnects
- No graceful cleanup of resources
- Potential memory leaks in long-running requests

### 3. **Critical: Missing Claude Configuration Initialization**

**Problem**: Claude Code expects a specific configuration file at `~/.claude.json`.

**Missing Configuration**:
```json
{
  "numStartups": 184,
  "autoUpdaterStatus": "enabled", 
  "userID": "64-char-random-string",
  "hasCompletedOnboarding": true,
  "lastOnboardingVersion": "1.0.17",
  "projects": {}
}
```

### 4. **High: Missing Support for `thinking` Field**

**Problem**: No support for Claude Code's reasoning/thinking mode.

**Missing Features**:
- `thinking` field in requests
- Smart model routing based on thinking mode
- Proper model selection logic

### 5. **High: Incomplete Tool Call Streaming**

**Problem**: Tool call streaming is not properly implemented.

**Issues**:
- No incremental JSON parsing for tool arguments
- Missing `input_json_delta` events
- No proper tool call buffering

### 6. **Medium: Missing Cache Token Usage Reporting**

**Problem**: No support for `cache_read_input_tokens` in usage reporting.

**Impact**: Inaccurate usage reporting for cached requests.

### 7. **Medium: Enhanced Error Classification**

**Problem**: Basic error classification without detailed error type mapping.

**Missing Features**:
- More sophisticated error type classification
- Better error message formatting
- Proper error code mapping

### 8. **Medium: Missing Model Command Support**

**Problem**: No support for `/model provider,model` commands for dynamic model switching.
